Example data pipelines for retail data architecture

Retail Data Pipeline Project

Overview

This project simulates a retail data pipeline, demonstrating key data engineering principles such as data ingestion, transformation, analysis, and machine learning modeling for predictive analytics. The pipeline is designed to ingest transactional data from a mock API, transform it into analytics-ready tables, and leverage machine learning to predict customer lifetime value (CLV).

Key Learning Objectives

  1. Setting Up a Transactional Database and Data Warehouse in PostgreSQL
     - Utilize PostgreSQL to store both raw transactional data and transformed data in a data warehouse optimized for analysis.
  
  2. Data Ingestion with Airbyte from Open APIs
     - Use Airbyte to extract data from an open API and load it into the PostgreSQL transactional database.
  
  3. Data Transformation with dbt for Data Warehousing
     - Leverage dbt (data build tool) to create cleaned and analytics-ready tables within the data warehouse schema.
  
  4. Machine Learning Model in Python for CLV Prediction
     - Train a basic machine learning model to predict customer lifetime value using historical transaction data.

  5. Data Analysis and Visualization with Python
     - Use Python's visualization libraries to analyze data and interpret model results.

Project Structure

  - `database/`: SQL scripts to create and manage the PostgreSQL database, including schemas and tables for transactional and data warehouse layers.
  
  - `airbyte/`: Configuration files for setting up Airbyte to ingest data from a mock API and load it into the PostgreSQL database.

  - `dbt/`: dbt project files, including models that transform raw data into analytics-ready tables in the data warehouse.

  - `ml_model/`: Python scripts for training a machine learning model to predict customer lifetime value (CLV) based on customer transaction history.

  - `visualizations/`: Python scripts for data analysis and visualization, including visualizations of customer segmentation and model predictions.

  - `docs/`: Project documentation and notes on setup, process flow, and methodologies used.

Technologies Used

  - PostgreSQL: Database system to store raw and transformed data.
  - Airbyte: Open-source ETL tool for data ingestion from API sources.
  - dbt: Transformation tool for creating organized and analytics-ready data models.
  - Python: For data analysis, machine learning modeling, and visualization.
    - Libraries: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

Workflow Steps

  1. Database Setup:
     - Initialize PostgreSQL with schemas for both transactional and data warehouse data.
  
  2. Data Ingestion with Airbyte:
     - Configure Airbyte to connect to a mock API for products, users, and transactions. Load data into the PostgreSQL transactional schema.
  
  3. Data Transformation with dbt:
     - Use dbt to transform raw transactional data into cleaned, analytics-ready tables in the warehouse schema.
  
  4. Machine Learning Model:
     - Train a linear regression model in Python to predict customer lifetime value (CLV) based on transactional history.
  
  5. Data Analysis and Visualization:
     - Generate visualizations to interpret the CLV model results and identify customer segments.

Future Improvements

  - Model Optimization: Experiment with advanced models (e.g., decision trees, random forests) for improved CLV predictions.
  - Dashboard Integration: Connect PostgreSQL to a BI tool like Metabase or Superset to visualize key metrics.
  - Automation: Implement Apache Airflow to schedule ETL and ML tasks for end-to-end automation.
